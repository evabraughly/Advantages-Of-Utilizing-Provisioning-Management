Telecommunication refers to the exchange of messages, words, writings, images, audio, signs, signals, or any information through various means such as satellite, cable, or wire. The message or information is often transmitted through the web, radio, electromagnetic systems, wired, optical, or satellite. Telecommunication takes place when there's an exchange of messages between participants of a communication pathway with the utilization of technology. Having an enormous clientele would mean that a telecommunication company must have a <a href="https://etisoftware.com/center-of-excellence/management/provisioning-management-system-for-networks//">provisioning management system</a>  to manage its workflows.

<b>What is Provisioning Management?</b>

Provisioning management is usually utilized by telecommunication companies. It refers to the provisioning system that handles the customer’s access and services on the telecommunication network elements. Companies like ETI provide telecommunication companies provisioning management services to assist them to handle their clientele and system workflow.

One of the most usual uses for provisioning is for customer relationship management (CRM) which has to be provisioned by a network element. This enables the service to be employed by the customer. When provisioning is happening, a tool used for service mediation would translate the parameters of the service into one or more other service parameters within the network. The term provisioning logic is that algorithm that translates a system to the network services.

A system with provisioning management aids in overseeing the company’s most vital factors that include the preparation, equipment, and maintenance of service for brand new customers, also because of the existing clientele. Provisioning involves a business-wide deployment and management of varied IT resources that would help with the reduction of customer churn rate and increase revenue. 

If a provisioning process isn't maintained by a management system would mean it's manually maintained. This can take too long with many errors which will hamper the system’s workflow which may annoy employees and frustrate customers. This is why it is highly recommended for every telecommunication company to have automated provisioning to streamline their process and avoid hurting their network in the long run.

<b>How is information transmitted by a telecommunication system?</b>

The message is transmitted via a transmission medium. An example is a transmission through physical media where it passes through electromagnetic waves and cable because it goes through light or radio. Transmission paths in these sorts of systems are differentiated into certain communication channels that utilize multiplexing.

Telecommunications is usually shortened to the term “telecom”. It involves information transmitting technologies that have fiber optics, wired telephones, wireless telephones, radio, microwave communications, television broadcasting, telegraphs, and the internet.

A single telecom circuit has two stations, wherein each system is equipped with a receiver and transmitter. The receiver and transmitter of any station are both combined on a transceiver. The signal transmissions are often transmitted through a cable or an electrical wire. Other mediums are often electromagnetic fields or glass fiber. Wireless telecommunication uses free space transmission and data reception through electromagnetic fields.

<b>What are the kinds of telecommunications networks?</b>

The most common telecommunications process happens between a transmitter and receiver which means there are two stations. However, it's also common that multiple stations exchange information among themselves. This arrangement is mentioned because of the telecommunications network. An example of a telecommunication network is the web. 

<b>Other smaller-scale telecommunication networks are:</b>

• Broadcast networks<br>
• Cellular networks<br>
• Police and fire communications systems<br>
• Telephone networks<br>
• Taxi dispatch networks<br>

These types of networks transmit information on a circuit through an electrical signal called the carrier. The carrier needs modulation to convey the data. These kinds of modulations are called digital or analog.

Digital modulation was used since the age of Morse codes. Modern communication systems use digital modulation through internet protocols to send data using physical transmissions. Analog modulation uses AM waves which are employed by radio broadcasting in their frequencies.

<b>What are telecommunications service providers?</b>

Telecommunication services vary like internet service providers, radio or television broadcasters, satellite TV, cable companies, and wireless service providers. The system deployed by the telecommunications sector is handled by telecommunication service providers. These service providers previously offered telephone or other related services but are now offering WAN and internet services. In some countries, telecommunication service providers are handled by governmental institutions. However, some providers have already been privatized. The United States has the Federal Communications Commission as its regulator within the telecommunications industry.
